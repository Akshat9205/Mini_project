# 🎯 Skill Progress Tracker with Gamification

“A fun and motivational way for students to stay consistent with their learning goals.”

## 🚀 Overview

For many students, improving their skills regularly is a major challenge.
We set goals—like practicing DSA, updating resumes, or improving communication—but:

❌ We fail to track progress
❌ We lose motivation
❌ Goals remain incomplete

The Skill Progress Tracker solves this problem by turning learning into a game-like experience.

# ✅ Features
🔹 Goal Setting

Students can add their learning goals such as:
✔ DSA
✔ Communication Skills
✔ Resume Building
✔ Projects
✔ Certifications
✔ Personal Development

🔹 XP (Experience Points) System

Users earn XP for completing tasks:

Easy tasks → Low XP

Hard tasks → High XP

This makes learning rewarding and engaging.

🔹 Daily Streak System

Completing tasks daily increases the user’s streak.
Breaking the streak reduces motivation—so this system keeps students consistent.

🔹 Badges

Users unlock badges based on their achievements:
🏅 Beginner
🏅 Consistent Performer
🏅 Pro Learner

🔹 Leaderboard

Students can compare their progress with others—
creating a healthy and motivating competition.

## 🔥 Why This Project Is Unique

This is not a normal task tracker.
It includes smart motivation-driven features:

XP adjusts according to task difficulty

Streak system builds daily discipline

Badges + leaderboard make learning fun

Overall, it provides a Duolingo-like experience for skill development.

## 🌍 Impact

“Students start completing their tasks the same way they complete levels in a game—
leading to higher consistency, stronger motivation, and better long-term skill growth.”

The Skill Progress Tracker helps students become:
✔ More disciplined
✔ More engaged
✔ More future-ready
